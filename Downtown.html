    <h1><b>How To Style Accordingly With Downtown Style</b></h1>
    <p><u>HISTORY</u></p>
    <h2>he term "downtown" originates from the United States and is commonly used to refer to the central area of cities. In the context of fashion, the downtown style emerged in the 1970s and 1980s in New York, specifically in neighborhoods like SoHo (South of Houston Street) and the East Village. These urban areas were inhabited by artists, musicians, young creatives, and counterculture individuals who sought more affordable spaces to live and work. As a result, a vibrant cultural scene began to develop, influencing fashion as well. </h2>
    <div class="mt-4">
    <p><u>BACKGROUND</u></p>
    <h2> The downtown style was shaped by the punk subculture, the artistic movement of the time, the Bohemian spirit, and the carefree attitude of the streets. Artists like Andy Warhol and Jean-Michel Basquiat, as well as musicians from the punk and new wave movements, played a significant role in shaping this style. They challenged traditional fashion conventions and expressed their individuality through bold and unconventional clothing. Since then, the downtown style has expanded to other cities around the world, becoming a global trend in urban fashion. However, its roots lie in New York's artistic and countercultural scene.</h2>

    <p><u>WHAT IS THE DOWNTOWN STYLE?</u></p>
    <h2>he cities themselves are most often rainy or in darker periods of the day. The aesthetic in general is more intimate, as opposed to sunny and open. Autumn is also an important element of the aesthetic. Fallen leaves, hot coffee, and sweaters are some of the most common photos in the aesthetic, and can even be featured in the music ("We Fell in Love in October" by Girl in Red, "Autumn in New York" sung by various jazz singers, etc.) Downtown Girls' and Boys' photos most often feature themselves visiting locations that have a hip, bookish vibe that matches the Bohemian and vintage connotations of being in a Downtown area. Specifically, places that sell secondhand goods and traditional media: bookstores, thrift shops, and record shops are the most favored. As the Internet becomes more common, these stores are harder to come by and are more exclusive to cities. Like the 2014 hipster era, possessing and admiring traditional and older media is seen as cool and unique. Images of people reading books is a common photo, especially with books that appear older and more artistic in subject. Likewise, all sorts of cameras, as opposed to the cameras from a phone, are featured and imply that the person in the photo has the hobby of photography. Photographers are also common in cities and are a more artistic and adventurous endeavor.</h2>
